         <h1>College During the Coronavirus</h1>
         <h3>comparing COVID-19 data across the University System of Maryland</h3>
         <p class=byline>by Emily Riley</p>
         <div class="intro">
            <p class="intro">If you’ve been a college student at some point in your life, you’re no stranger to the common cold. Whether you got a bug in your 200-person lecture, while picking up a bite to eat in a crowded dining hall, at a party with friends or from your not-so-clean roommate, colleges across the nation are notorious for germs.</p>
            <p class="intro">However with the coronavirus vastly changing what day-to-day activities look like for the typical student, college campuses have come to resemble ghost towns. Sporting events have limited capacity, residence halls are only offering single rooms and in-person classes are few and far between.</p>
            <p class="intro">As students struggle to adapt to an online world, their universities also have to figure out how to handle cases. Tuition prices remain sky-high and the end of the virus is out of sight. This leaves parents and students alike wondering the same question: <span style="color: #ed621c;"><i>How will universities prioritize safety  and enforce transparency with students?</i></span></p>
            <p class="intro">According to research from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-college-cases-tracker.html" target=_blank>the New York Times</a>, <span style="color: #ed621c;">“more than 50 colleges have reported at least 1,000 cases over the course of the pandemic, and more than 400 colleges have reported at least 100 cases.”</span> Maryland is no different.</p>
            <p class="intro">The University System of Maryland represents Maryland’s public universities. In an effort to better understand how schools have been handling COVID-19, I analyzed data from four of the system’s most prominent schools: the University of Maryland, College Park, the University of Maryland Baltimore County, Towson University and Salisbury University. All four universities opened this fall.

                  <p>Located in the heart of Prince George’s County, just a 15-minute drive from the nation’s capital is the <a href="https://www.umd.edu/" target="_blank">University of Maryland, College Park.</a> UMD has had the most cases compared to the other schools analyzed at <span style="color:#ed621c;">609 cases</span> of COVID-19 during their fall semester, according to the University's coronavirus dashboard. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Although the school is home to nearly <span style="color:#ed621c;">30,000 undergraduate students</span>, their campus density was only at <span style="color:#ed621c;">22 percent</span> last week (November 29), which reflects the already decreased amount of students living on-campus, even less due to the fact that students couldn't return to school if they went home for Thanksgiving break.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Data from the school’s COVID-19 dashboard reflects a <span style="color:#ed621c;">steep downward trend</span> since a peak in early September. The school has a positivity rate of just <span style="color:#ed621c;">.6 percent this week.</span> This makes it one one of the lowest weekly positivity rating among the other USM schools analyzed.</p>

Towson's amount of cases is also only 82 less than the University of Maryland, even though having a significantly smaller student population.

                    <br>Even though at significantly higher rate than the four other universities, Towson is still undeniably lower than Baltimore County, which has a positivity rate of <span style="color:#ed621c;">7.5 percent.</span></p>

                  <p>Although a medium-sized university, UMBC has maintained shockingly low amounts of cases, with only <span style="color:#ed621c;">58 reported</span> this fall semester, according to their coronavirus dashboard.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Whether a result of only <span style="color:#ed621c;">1,276 students living in residence halls</span> this semester or reflective of their testing policy, the campus seems to be the most successful at keeping their bubble of cases to a minimum. Although maintaining a relatively low positivity rate, the school saw a sharp increase in the past week to a <span style="color:#ed621c;">2.5% positivity rate</span>. This could be possibly due to students bringing the virus back on campus with them after traveling for the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
